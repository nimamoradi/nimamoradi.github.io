# JAX vs NumPy: A Performance Comparison

[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is a relatively new library from Google that aims to bring together NumPy's ease of use, the advantages of autodiff, and the speed of XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra). While it's designed to work seamlessly with GPUs and TPUs, it's also interesting to see how it performs on CPUs compared to the well-established NumPy library.

## What is JAX?

JAX is described as "Autograd and XLA, brought together for high-performance machine learning research." It offers:

1. A familiar NumPy-style API
2. Automatic differentiation of native Python and NumPy functions
3. Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to GPU/TPU

While JAX is primarily aimed at machine learning researchers, its NumPy-like interface makes it an interesting alternative for general scientific computing tasks.

## Performance Comparison

We ran a benchmark comparing JAX and NumPy for common array operations on a 1000x1000 matrix. Here are the results:

| Operation | NumPy Time (s) | JAX Time (s) | Faster |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| Matrix Multiplication | 0.004825 | 0.004053 | JAX |
| Element-wise Multiplication | 0.000879 | 0.000281 | JAX |
| Matrix-Vector Multiplication | 0.000128 | 0.000079 | JAX |
| Sum | 0.000231 | 0.001109 | NumPy |
| Mean | 0.000230 | 0.001106 | NumPy |
| Transpose | 0.000001 | 0.000297 | NumPy |
| Inverse | 0.021859 | 0.022489 | NumPy |
| Eigenvalues | 0.423519 | 0.360369 | JAX |
| SVD | 0.237887 | 0.307350 | NumPy |
| FFT | 0.011997 | 0.010373 | JAX |

## Analysis

Based on these results, we can observe:

1. **JAX outperforms NumPy** in matrix multiplication, element-wise multiplication, and matrix-vector multiplication. These are fundamental operations in many scientific computing and machine learning tasks.

2. JAX is significantly faster for **eigenvalue computation**, which can be crucial for certain linear algebra applications.

3. JAX also shows a slight edge in **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** operations.

4. Surprisingly, **NumPy is faster for simpler operations** like sum, mean, and transpose. This might be due to the overhead of JAX's compilation process for these simpler operations.

5. NumPy also performs better for **matrix inversion and SVD** in this benchmark.

## Considerations for Using JAX

While JAX shows promising performance in several areas, the decision to use it over NumPy should consider several factors:

1. **Task Complexity**: JAX seems to shine more on complex operations. For simpler tasks, NumPy might be sufficient or even faster.

2. **GPU Availability**: Our benchmark was on <b>CPU</b>. JAX's performance advantage could be more pronounced when using GPUs.

3. **Learning Curve**: While JAX aims to be NumPy-compatible, it has its own quirks and features that require learning.

4. **Ecosystem**: NumPy has a vast ecosystem of compatible libraries. JAX is newer and its ecosystem is still growing.

5. **Automatic Differentiation**: If your work involves gradient computations, JAX's built-in autodiff capabilities could be a significant advantage.

## Conclusion

JAX shows promising performance for many array operations, particularly for more complex computations. However, NumPy still holds its ground for simpler operations. The choice between JAX and NumPy should depend on your specific use case, the complexity of your computations, and whether you need features like automatic differentiation or GPU acceleration.
